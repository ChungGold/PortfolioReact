            <h1>Hello, my name is Chung Au</h1>
            <p>Iâ€™m a frontend developer with a knack for CSS. 
            I enjoy building the front-end of websites and applications from the ground up. 
            I have a lot of fun with UI/UX, but I get true satisfaction from crunching code in 
            React.js, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I documented all of my growth as a developer on 
            LinkedIn since day 1, check it out!</p>
