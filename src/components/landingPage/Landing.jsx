                <p>Iâ€™m a frontend developer with a knack for CSS. I enjoy building the front-end of websites and applications from the ground up. I have a lot of fun with UI/UX, but I get true satisfaction from crunching code in React.js, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I documented all of my growth as a developer on LinkedIn since day 1, check it out! </p>
